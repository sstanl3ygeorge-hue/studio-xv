          'Productive patterns get you closer to done. Avoidance patterns make you feel busy without progress. Example: tweaking EQ for 20 minutes is avoidance.',

          'Rest is intentional. Procrastination is avoidance disguised as "I\'ll do it later." If you feel guilty, it\'s probably procrastination.',

        keyTakeaways: [
          'You doubt your ears because you compare yourself to professionals with 10+ years of experience. They weren\'t confident on day one either. Trust builds with practice.',
          'Analyzers (spectrum, meters) are useful for confirmation, not decision-making. If it sounds good but looks wrong, trust your ears. If it sounds bad, no analyzer will fix it.',
