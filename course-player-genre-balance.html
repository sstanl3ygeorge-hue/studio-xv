  STUDIO XV COURSE PLAYER TEMPLATE
  ================================================================
  
  HOW TO CREATE A NEW COURSE:
  
  1. Duplicate this file and rename it:
     Example: course-player-finishing-tracks.html
              course-player-mixing-basics.html
              course-player-arrangement.html
  
  2. Update the <title> tag below (line 11)
  
  3. Update the courseConfig object (around line 120):
     - title: Your course name
     - backLink: Link to your course landing page
     - backLinkText: Text for back button
     - totalDuration: Total course length
     - moduleCount: Number of modules
  
  4. Replace the lessons array (starting around line 130):
     - Each lesson needs: id, module, moduleTitle, lesson, title,
       duration, description, inThisLesson, keyTakeaways, resources
  
  5. Update the sidebar HTML (starting around line 650):
     - Module titles and lesson titles must match your lessons array
     - IMPORTANT: Keep this exact structure for each lesson:
       <a href="#" class="lesson-item ...">
         <div class="flex items-center flex-1">
           <span class="lesson-check">✓</span>
           <div class="flex-1">
             <p class="text-sm font-medium">LESSON TITLE</p>
             <p class="text-xs" ...>DURATION</p>
           </div>
         </div>
       </a>
     - The checkmark span is hidden by default and shows when completed
  
  6. Update completion modal "What you've learned" section (line 850)
  
  That's it! All navigation, progress tracking, checkmarks, and 
  interactions will work automatically.

        keyTakeaways: [
          'Electronic music typically separates sub and kick into distinct frequency zones—sub below 60Hz, kick above. This creates punch and clarity without low-end mud.',
          'Not every electronic genre uses the same approach. House and techno often blend them more, while dubstep and drum & bass need surgical separation.',

        ],
        keyTakeaways: [
          'Vocals and synths often fight in the 1-3kHz range. The solution isn\'t always EQ—sometimes it\'s stereo placement, timing, or simply choosing which element leads.',
          'Dynamic EQ and sidechain techniques let synths breathe around vocals without permanently cutting frequencies. This preserves fullness while maintaining clarity.',
          'Electronic mixes can be dense, but the best ones still have space. If everything is loud and wide, nothing is.'

          'Drops only hit hard when builds set them up properly. If your build is already at full frequency and loudness, the drop has nowhere to go.',
          'Effective builds create tension through reduction, not addition. Remove low end, thin out mid-range, create space—then the drop fills it.',

        keyTakeaways: [
          'Hip-hop vocals sit forward but not isolated. The vocal should feel like it\'s on top of the beat, not floating above it. This comes from careful high-mid EQ and compression.',
          'Beat density is part of the genre. Don\'t over-carve the instrumental—hip-hop mixes are supposed to feel full. The vocal wins through level and presence, not excessive space.',
          'Reference modern hip-hop tracks to calibrate your vocal level. Too quiet is amateur, but too loud disconnects the vocal from the beat.'

        ],
        keyTakeaways: [
          '808s and kicks serve different purposes. Kicks provide transient punch, 808s provide sustained low-end weight. Both can coexist if you tune them correctly.',
          'The 808 should be tuned to the key of your track. Out-of-tune 808s create dissonance that no amount of EQ will fix.',
          'Different hip-hop subgenres balance 808s differently. Trap 808s dominate; boom-bap kicks lead. Study your references to understand your genre\'s conventions.'

        keyTakeaways: [
          'Samples often have different tonal characteristics than your original elements. Use subtle EQ and saturation to blend them into the same sonic space.',
          'Don\'t over-process vintage samples trying to make them sound modern. The character is the point—just make sure they sit at the right level.',
          'If your sample sounds disconnected, it\'s usually a volume or EQ issue, not a lack of effects. Start simple before reaching for complex processing.'

        ],
        keyTakeaways: [
          'Rock mixes often have multiple guitar tracks competing in the same frequency range. The solution is width, not level—pan rhythm guitars hard and use different tones for each side.',
          'Too much distortion creates mid-range mush. If your guitars sound muddy, reduce gain on the amp or use a tighter distortion sound.',
          'Leave space in the center for vocals, bass, and kick. Guitars can dominate the sides, but the middle needs breathing room.'

        ],
        keyTakeaways: [
          'Rock vocals need to cut through without sounding harsh. This comes from boosting 2-4kHz presence and using aggressive compression to control dynamics.',
          'Don\'t rely solely on vocal boosts—reduce competing guitar frequencies between 1-3kHz so vocals have space.',
          'Rock vocal chains are typically more aggressive than other genres: heavier compression, more saturation, tighter de-essing. Reference professional rock mixes to calibrate your approach.'

        keyTakeaways: [
          'Bass guitar and rhythm guitars often clash in the 200-500Hz range, creating muddy low-mids. High-pass guitars around 80-120Hz to give bass exclusive access to the low end.',
          'Bass needs to be both felt and heard. Boost around 100Hz for weight, 800Hz-1kHz for definition. If the bass disappears on small speakers, add more high-mids.',

          <p>
            Vocals and synths often fight in the 1-3kHz range. The solution isn't always EQ—sometimes it's stereo placement, timing, or simply choosing which element leads.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dynamic EQ and sidechain techniques let synths breathe around vocals without permanently cutting frequencies. This preserves fullness while maintaining clarity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Electronic mixes can be dense, but the best ones still have space. If everything is loud and wide, nothing is.
