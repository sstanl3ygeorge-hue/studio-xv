  STUDIO XV COURSE PLAYER TEMPLATE
  ================================================================
  
  HOW TO CREATE A NEW COURSE:
  
  1. Duplicate this file and rename it:
     Example: course-player-finishing-tracks.html
              course-player-mixing-basics.html
              course-player-arrangement.html
  
  2. Update the <title> tag below (line 11)
  
  3. Update the courseConfig object (around line 120):
     - title: Your course name
     - backLink: Link to your course landing page
     - backLinkText: Text for back button
     - totalDuration: Total course length
     - moduleCount: Number of modules
  
  4. Replace the lessons array (starting around line 130):
     - Each lesson needs: id, module, moduleTitle, lesson, title,
       duration, description, inThisLesson, keyTakeaways, resources
  
  5. Update the sidebar HTML (starting around line 650):
     - Module titles and lesson titles must match your lessons array
     - IMPORTANT: Keep this exact structure for each lesson:
       <a href="#" class="lesson-item ...">
         <div class="flex items-center flex-1">
           <span class="lesson-check">✓</span>
           <div class="flex-1">
             <p class="text-sm font-medium">LESSON TITLE</p>
             <p class="text-xs" ...>DURATION</p>
           </div>
         </div>
       </a>
     - The checkmark span is hidden by default and shows when completed
  
  6. Update completion modal "What you've learned" section (line 850)
  
  That's it! All navigation, progress tracking, checkmarks, and 
  interactions will work automatically.

          'Decision fatigue happens when you spend more time deciding what to do than actually doing it. The solution isn\'t faster decisions—it\'s fewer decisions that matter more.',

          'Most unfinished tracks have great individual sections but no energy arc across the whole track. Listeners need contrast and momentum.',
